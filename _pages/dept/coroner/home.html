              The Coroner may use many different methods when determining the cause and manner of death. This includes medical records from physicians, hospitals, and other health care facilities. Federal Code concerning protected health information specifically indicates that protected health information can be disseminated to Coroners for the purpose of aiding an investigation into the cause and manner of death and to assist in the identification of a deceased. Although these records are placed in the case file, they are not subject to public view.

              Per Idaho Code, Title 19, Chapter 43, Section 194301B, the coroner may authorize an autopsy without consent of the next of kin. The forensic autopsy includes a detailed external examination, surgical examination, X-rays, and collection of tissue and bodily fluids. Tissues are prepared and examined microscopically by a forensic pathologist. Bodily fluids are submitted to one or more laboratories locally and throughout the United States for analysis for the detection and quantization of alcohol, prescription or illicit drugs, or poisons. Cultures may also be prepared for determining viral or bacterial diseases. The results are reviewed by the forensics pathologist to aid in determining the cause of death.

              Death certificates are prepared by the funeral home. Once the investigation is complete, the Coroner will record and certify the death certificate to reflect the cause and manner of death. This information will then be transmitted to the State of Idaho, Department of Vital Statistics. The Coroner does not issue death certificates to the general public. Death certificates are only available from the State of Idaho, Department of Vital Statistics.

              The Latah Coroner´s Office in conjunction with law enforcement may collect personal property that is determined to be evidentiary value for safe keeping. Real property, such as residential dwellings, buildings, or automobiles are sealed or secured until the legal next of kin is identified. In most cases, property determined not to be of value to the investigation, will be turned over to legal next of kin. Prescription medications or contraband will be disposed, destroyed or turned over to law enforcement officials.

              Contrary to popular belief, visual identification by family or friends is not usually necessary. Many methods are used to identify remains by the Coroner's Office. In most cases, photographic identification is all that is required. Occasionally, other methods such as fingerprints, tattoos, jewelry, X-rays are utilized for positive identification. We understand that family may want to view their loved one as soon as possible. It is recommended that this be done at the funeral home facility. We will work with funeral homes to insure this can be accomplished as quickly as possible.
