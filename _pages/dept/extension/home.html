        <h4>Nationally</h4>
        <p>
          The Extension System is a public-funded, non-formal, educational system that links education and research resources and activities of the USDA, 74 land-grant universities and 3,150 counties. Extension's purpose is education for Americans to use in dealing with the critical issues that have an impact on their lives and the nation's future.

          Agricultural and horticultural extension provides educational programs on production, management, marketing and sustainability to area farmers, ranchers, nursery, orchard and wood lot owners. One program is the ClearWater Direct Seeders, a group of multi-county, multi-state growers who exchange ideas, discuss the latest technology and strive to promote environmentally sound direct seed cropping systems through meetings, workshops and tours.

          The Master Gardener program provides specialized horticulture training to community members. These trained volunteers help answer questions through community service in the form of plant clinics offered at the office on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and Moscow Farmers Market every Saturday, May through September. They also assist in horticulture projects such as the Demonstration Garden on First Street in Moscow and teaching beginning gardeners and youth about gardening.
