        <p><strong>Nationally</strong></p>
      <p>All universities engage in research and teaching, but the nation's more than 100 land-grant colleges and universities have a third, critical mission &mdash; Extension.&nbsp; Extension is a public-funded, non-formal system to provide education, research resources, and learning activities to people throughout the country &mdash; to farmers and other residents of rural communities as well as to people living in urban areas. Extension&rsquo;s purpose is to take the knowledge gained through research and education and bring it directly to the people to create positive changes and to have an impact on their lives and the nation&rsquo;s future.&nbsp; Through Extension, land-grant colleges and universities bring vital, practical information to agricultural producers, small business owners, consumers, families, and young people.</p>
