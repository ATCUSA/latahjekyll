            There is a District Court in each of the 44 counties of the state. These courts are divided into seven judicial districts with four to ten counties in each district. Latah County is one of five counties which comprise the Second Judicial District. District Court is divided into two sections, the District Court and the Magistrate Division. District Judges are elected by qualified electors in district-wide elections on a non-partisan ballot every four years. Magistrates are appointed by a District Magistrate Commission.After initial appointment to a two-year term, a Magistrate may be re-elected on a retention ballot to a four-year term. Latah County has two resident Judges, one District and one Magistrate. The District Judge has original jurisdiction in all cases and proceedings; in the issuance of writs of mandamus, certiorari, prohibition, habeas corpus and all writs necessary to the exercise of his/her powers; appellate jurisdiction extends to all cases assigned to the Magistrate's division of the District Court and to all other matters and cases where an appeal is allowed by law. The Magistrate Judge is responsible for infractions/trials, misdemeanors/trials, small claims court, felony probable-cause hearings/felony preliminary hearings, divorce proceedings, domestic violence hearings and is granted jurisdiction in civil proceedings where the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000. Both District Judge and Magistrate Judge conduct jury trials; each issues subpoenas, warrants of arrest and each hears probation violation matters.

                If the person charged wishes to deny the offense, they may do so either by checking the “not guilty” box on the reverse side of the citation and mailing it to the above address so it arrives no later than the appearance date, telephoning the Clerk's Office at (208) 883-2255 and entering their denial over the phone, or by stopping by the Clerk's Office at 522 South Adams and denying the charge. The clerk will then set a trial date and provide written notice to the defendant and the prosecutor.
