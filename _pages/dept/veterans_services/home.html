            Providing assistance to veterans and dependents, under the direction of the County Commissioners, is the responsibility of this office. They assist, at no fee to the applicant, in the preparation of forms and supporting evidence to be submitted to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or the Idaho State Division of Veterans Service when applying for veterans benefits such as disability compensation and pensions, medical assistance, death claims and residency at the state veterans homes. The Spokane VA Medical Center Mobile Health Clinic is available for follow-up care in Moscow on a monthly basis; transportation is available for veterans with appointments at the VAMC on Wednesdays and Fridays. Office hours are Monday, Tuesday and Thursday 8:00–11:30 a.m. and 1:00–5:00 p.m. Alternate arrangements can be made if an applicant is unable to come in during these hours.
