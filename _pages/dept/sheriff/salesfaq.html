        NO. Cancellations will be posted on the website as soon as possible, but you should call the Sheriff's Office Civil Department approximately ONE (1) HOUR prior to sale to make sure that the auction has not been cancelled. The Sheriff's Office does not send personnel to the sale location to notify potential bidders that a sale has been cancelled.

      Every effort is made to identify and notify any and all lien holders of property that is seized for sale. This information is given in the item description and announced prior to sale. The Sheriff will give possession but does not guarantee clear title nor continued possessory right to the purchaser. Purchaser will be subject to all liens, sales tax and any other encumbrances. The Sheriff, by certificate of sale will transfer the right, title and interest of the tax payer in and to the property at the time of levy.
