        The Field Division is most commonly involved with citizen interaction both in the office and in the field. Much of this Division's work is done away from the Sheriff's Office.
        The statutory duties of the Sheriff's Office is clear and includes: Preserving the peace, arresting and taking before magistrates all those who commit or attempt to commit
        public offenses, prevent affrays, breaches of the peace, insurrections and riots, to serve and document service and record service of all required legal process, to issue
        Concealed Weapons Permits, to issue Driver's Licenses, to work with the Idaho Department of Law Enforcement in the safe use of public highways, to safeguard and protect
        highway surfaces, to enforce livestock inspection, transportation and theft violations, to regulate traffic on all highways and roads including response to and investigation
        of wrecks, and to investigate all cases involving missing children.
        <br><br>
        This Division is responsible for patrolling over 200 miles of State Highway and over 1,000 miles of county roads. The total size of our county is 1,100 square miles.
        <br><br>
        The Field Division is responsible for the enforcement of all penal provisions and laws of the state of Idaho.
        This division operates a fleet of 18 marked patrol vehicles, six administrative and detectives' vehicles, and one special administrative vehicle shared by
        the entire department for special needs.
        <br><br>
        This year we asked for and received funding from the County Commissioners to purchase and equip five new patrol vehicles.
        This allowed us to reach a goal that we have been striving for, and that is to have take-home vehicles for all Patrol Deputies.
        This achieves several goals, with each deputy having a take home vehicle it will increase the life of the vehicles from two to three years, to four to five years.
         When we have an emergency call out the response time will be substantially reduced.
