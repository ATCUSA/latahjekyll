      The Latah County Jail is located in the basement of the Latah County Courthouse. The main entrance to the Jail is on Sixth Street just west of Van Buren. Attorneys, visitors, ministers, etc. should use this entrance. The Latah County Jail can be reached by telephone at (208) 882-2216. There is no parking near the Sixth Street entrance, so you will need to park on Van Buren Street or in the parking lot and walk to the Sixth Street entrance. People coming into the Jail can be searched for weapons and contraband.
