        Usually, your insurance company will request a copy so you don't have to. If you do need a copy of an accident you were in, request one from the Records Department between 7am and 3pm, excluding holidays, Monday to Friday. You will need to provide the date, time and location of the accident and fill out a request for public records form.  There is no cost.
