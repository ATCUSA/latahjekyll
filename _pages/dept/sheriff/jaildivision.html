					The Latah County Jail is an adult male and female holding facility that was built in 1972. The jail is designed to hold adults being charged with a crime while
					awaiting trial, and those adults sentenced for a crime. We also hold for other forms of due process.
					We house adult prisoners for the Idaho State Police, Moscow Police Department,
					United States Marshals Service, Bureau of Prisons, Idaho Department of Corrections, other various
					counties and our own agency. The jail has a maximum holding capacity of 41 individuals.
					<br><br>
					The jail is also capable of temporarily holding male and female juveniles. We have a juvenile room capable of holding 1 juvenile at a time.
					A juvenile may be placed in this room for up to 72 hours then must be transferred out to a Juvenile Detention Center.
					<br><br>
					The jail is staffed by 1 Sergeant, 3 Corporals and 8 Deputies working 3 different shifts. The jail admits new bookings and releases inmates twenty four hours a day as
					well as keeping the jail sanitary. Day shift dispenses medication, feeds inmates morning and after meals, delivers and receives individuals from court, transports inmates
					to different agencies and provides housed inmates access to the library, recreation yard, attorney's and clergy. Swing shift also dispenses medications, feeds inmates
					the evening meal, provides access to the library, recreation yard, attorney's and clergy, delivers and receives individuals from court, transports inmates to
					different agencies, provides special programs to inmates. Graveyard shift dispenses medication, completes lock down, security checks, bookings and releases
					and releases morning work release inmates.
					<br><br>
					The jail's library consists of reading books, a weight machine and a stationary bike for personal use. We also have an outside recreation yard.
					Both the library and recreation yard are constantly monitored. Inmates are allowed one hour per day in either location. The library contains a complete set of
					Idaho Code books and Federal Code books for legal research.
					<br><br>
					The jail offers special programs to inmates to include Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, church services, a G.E.D program and a correspondence
					course through the University of Idaho.
					<br><br>
					Prisoners are also offered visitation with family or friends. Males inmates are allowed to visit Sunday's 1:00-4:00 PM and Thursdays 7:00-9:00 PM.
					Female inmates are allowed visitors Monday's 7:00-9:00 PM and Thursdays 1:00-3:00 PM. All visits are in special visiting rooms and are non-contact.
					<br><br>
					Home health nurses come into the jail twice a week for inmate sick call. They handle the majority of the cases and for those cases that require a physician,
					we have a local licensed physician on retainer.
