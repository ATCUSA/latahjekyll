                Once a youth admits or is found guilty of an offense, they are typically placed on probation.  Prior to disposition each youth receives a comprehensive risk and needs assessment and treatment plans are created to target areas of criminogenic need as well as to address areas of the Balanced Approach.  Elements of probation typically include, but are not limited to; assigning a curfew, mandating school / educational program attendance, urinalysis testing, community service, restitution, participation in counseling and/or groups, use of electronic home monitoring and/or detention, restrictions on activities/associations, and meetings with the probation officer.  The objective of probation is to hold the youth accountable, protect the community, and work with the youth to develop competencies and lower their level of risk to re-offend.

                Adult Misdemeanor Probation was established in Latah County in 2008.  The purpose of the probation program was to hold misdemeanor offenders accountable for their crime, while remaining in the community.  Those who are placed on probation are required to meet with a probation officer regularly, submit to searches, and drug testing.  Working closely with other social service agencies, the probation department hopes to provide appropriate intervention programs to enhance their competencies and reduce future re-offending.  Some programs that the offenders are referred to include: substance abuse; domestic violence; mental health; parenting; and anger management.  Further, Latah County Probation Officers encourage employment, sobriety, and personal growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Typical offenses of those placed on supervised probation in Latah County include:  Driving Under the Influence, Domestic Violence, Assault, Battery, Violation of Protection Order, Misdemeanor Drug Offenses, and Felonies amended to misdemeanors.  If the offender chooses to violate his/her terms of probation, the offender may return to Court for appropriate sanctions.  Sanctions may include full imposition of their suspended jail sentence, electronic monitoring, or community service.  Latah County Misdemeanor Probation also maintains strong partnerships with law enforcement and other justice agencies.  Latah County is also involved with the Latah County Mental Health Court.

                In lieu of going to detention, youth may be ordered to go to work camp, an overnight community service project in conjunction with the US Forest Service.  The youth pay a small fee to help cover the cost of worker’s compensation insurance and meals.  The youth are transported to a forest service site where they will perform two days of community service, spend the night, and engage in educational programs and activities under the supervision of Youth Services’ staff.  The objective of this program is to hold the youth accountable for their behavior while providing them with an opportunity to give back to the community while developing new skills and an appreciation of outdoor activities.

                Latah County Youth Services has no stronger partner than the Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections.  Nearly 1/3rd of our revenue comes from IDJC to help us meet the needs of juvenile offenders here in the community.  When it is no longer safe to maintain them in the community, we can commit them to the custody of IDJC to receive intervention services in a more structured setting until they are ready to transition home.  Please visit http://www.idjc.idaho.gov/ for more information.
