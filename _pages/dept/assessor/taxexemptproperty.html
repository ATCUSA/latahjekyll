          Beginning in 2006, exempt property owners must complete an application that documents ownership, nature of the use of the property, and, if applicable, purpose and source of revenue for the owning organization. This standardized process will also be applied to all new requests for exemption this year and in the future. Beginning in 2007, owners of property that is already exempt will re-apply annually by completing a simple one-page form certifying that the ownership and use of the property remains unchanged.
