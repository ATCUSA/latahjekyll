    There is a Solid Waste Advisory Committee (SWAC) which consists of representatives from rural cities. This committee exists to communicate solid waste needs, alleviate problems and improve programs. They are committed to keeping solid waste costs down.
  This committee is open to anyone who is interested and is solely an advisory committee. Meetings are held as needed, typically scheduled on the third Tuesday of the month at 5:30pm in the City Hall Council Chambers. Please call if you would like more information.
