    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><b>Solid waste must fit in roll cart with lid closed for driveway service.</b></div>
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><b>Roll cart must be placed where your driveway intersects with a county or state road prior to 7am</b>.</div>

		Anything placed outside the roll cart on collection day will be assessed $5.00 per item or if the lid does not close due to overflow. Your first collection after Christmas will not be billed for extras.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lids must be closed to prevent the disposal cost of water weight and to avoid littering or animal problems. A correctly sized cart will allow for occasional extra trash. Garbage tags are no longer accepted for extra trash.
	</p>
	<p>
		E-waste must not be placed in roll carts. All E-waste (such as computer monitors/towers, printers, TVÂ’s and stereos, etc) must be taken to Moscow Recycling Center for free disposal.
	</p>

		To change roll cart size call Latah County Solid Waste. There is a fee of $18.00 to change out the cart if you are outside of your 60 day trial period.
