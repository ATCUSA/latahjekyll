            Under the direction of the Sheriff, this department administers written driver's tests (road driver's tests are administered by private skills testers) and provides applicants who have passed these tests with an approved Idaho State Driver's License. This department also issues and renews current Idaho driver's licenses and identification cards, drivers education permits and takes photos for concealed weapons permits. This department is located at the Latah County Annex at 200 S. Almon Street in Moscow.
