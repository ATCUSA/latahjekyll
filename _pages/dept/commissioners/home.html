        This elected three-member board is the governing body of Latah County, from left to right: Tom Lamar (Chair, District II), Richard Walser (District I), and Dave McGraw (District II). The Board has the ability, by ordinance, to meet Monday through Friday, 9:00 to 5:00 p.m. Usually however, the Board meets Mondays and Wednesdays, between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. The Board Members also attend off-site and evening meetings throughout the week as scheduled.
        <br><br>
        All meetings of the Board are open to the public with the exception of Executive Sessions. Books, records and accounts of the meetings are open for public inspection in the Clerk's office.
        <br><br>
        The Board of Commissioners is a unique body in government. It is the only office that has legislative, executive and judicial responsibilities and duties. The Commissioners have the power to pass ordinances, adopt budgets, fix tax levy rates and oversee the county budget. They are charged with the duty of supervising the official conduct of all county officers as their conduct relates to public monies and revenues, as well as supervising appointed boards and committees. They also act as the Board of Equalization.
        <br><br>
        The Board sits as a quasi-judicial body to hear various matters including planning and zoning requests, property valuation protests and requests for cancellation of taxes, and indigent issues among many others.
