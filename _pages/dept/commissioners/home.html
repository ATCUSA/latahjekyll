The Commissioners have the power to pass ordinances, adopt budgets, fix tax levy rate and oversee the county budget. They are charged with the duty of supervising the official conduct of all county officers as their conduct relates to public monies and revenues, as well as supervising appointed boards and committees. They also act as the Board of Equalization.
