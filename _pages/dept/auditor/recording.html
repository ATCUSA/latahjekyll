    As recorder, the county clerk is responsible for recording, filing, and indexing a large number of legal documents. The recorder has custody of, and must keep, all books, records, maps and papers deposited in his/her office (IC 31-2401). These documents are essential for many types of legal transactions and are frequently referred to by attorneys, title companies, real estate brokers, and others in the county. The recorder collects fees for recording and providing copies of legal documents, and these fees go into the county treasury.
