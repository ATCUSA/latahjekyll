        Richard Walser was born in Moscow and grew up on a farm between Potlatch and Viola.  He attended grade school and high school in Potlatch and graduated from the University of Idaho with a degree in Architecture.  Rather than pursue a career in architecture however, Richard returned to the farm where he farmed and raised cattle for over 30 years.  During that time he served on the boards of several farm organizations.

        After retiring from farming, Richard then began working part time at Tri-State in the hardware department.  He is pleased to report that while his wealth made no dramatic change at that job, he now owns every hand tool known to man.

        He and his wife, Vicki, still reside in their farm home.  However, the only livestock they still care for is their dog, "Buster".  Richard is currently serving in his 2nd term as one of the Latah County Commissioners, a job he is happy and humbled to do !
